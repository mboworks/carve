// Combines records from several independently-produced sidecars into one set.
// Records are de-duplicated by (project_id, action_key) - the natural identity
// of an action across shards - keeping the most-recently-written record on a
// collision (highest `written_at`; an unstamped `written_at == 0` therefore
// loses to any stamped record). The result is sorted by (project_id,
// action_key) for determinism, and `schema_version` is taken from the first
// input that sets one. Pure: no filesystem access.
//
// This is the offline counterpart to `sidecar::MergeRecords`: where Merge folds
// one project's freshly-built records into a stored sidecar (preserving other
// projects), Combine unions many complete sidecars that were produced
// separately (e.g. parallel build shards of one workspace) into a single set.
[[nodiscard]] ActionRecords Combine(absl::Span<const ActionRecords> inputs);

// Loads each sidecar in `sidecar_paths`, combines them (see `Combine`), projects
// the result into a compilation database whose sources are resolved against
// `directory` (the shared execroot the sidecars' sources are relative to), and
// atomically writes the JSON database to `output_path`. Returns the number of
// entries written.
//
// Also builds the header -> owning-action `HeaderIndex` from the combined
// records' `headers` (via `sidecar::BuildHeaderIndex`, the same builder
// `refresh` uses) and writes it to `headers-index.binpb` in `output_path`'s
// directory, matching refresh's index filename and its "next to the CDB"
// placement. When the merged shards carry no headers (`record_headers` off) the
// index is empty apart from its schema version but is still written, as refresh
// does. See CARVE_DESIGN.md sections 4.4-4.5.
//
// A missing sidecar contributes no records and is not an error (a shard that
// produced nothing); a sidecar that exists but does not parse is an error.
