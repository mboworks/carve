"""Layer C: an aspect that emits one cacheable shard per compile action.

`cc_carve_aspect` walks the cc graph and, for every C++ compile action it finds,
schedules a `carve_shard` build action that writes a one-record shard (an
`ActionRecords` binary proto). The shards are collected in the `carve_shards`
output group and merged into a compilation database by `carve aggregate` (see
`carve_aspect_refresh` in carve.bzl).

The tool is `carve_shard`, not the full `carve` binary: it is the lean, scan-free
build of the `shard` subcommand and links neither scan_deps nor the from-source
LLVM, so this per-compile-action build tool stays cheap to build (a full
LLVM-linked exec tool per action would be untenable).

The compile command is read straight from `action.argv`: Bazel hands back the
fully-expanded driver command line (param files already expanded, no `@file`
indirection), which is exactly what `carve_shard` de-Bazels into a database entry.

A shard's content is a function of the compile command alone, so each shard
action's only input is its `command_file`. Bazel's action cache then re-runs an
individual shard exactly when that translation unit's *command* changes (a new
flag, define, or dependency) - the per-action incrementality Layers A/B cannot
offer (CARVE_DESIGN.md sections 3.1, 4.7). Editing source/header *content* leaves
the command, and therefore the database entry, unchanged, so no re-shard is
needed (clangd re-reads the changed files itself). By default a shard records no
headers (`carve_shard` links no scanner), and delegating invalidation to Bazel
avoids touching every TU. The opt-in `record_headers` parameter feeds each shard
the compile's own dependency file (`-MF .../x.d`) and records the exact #include
set (ASPECT_M) for a shard-built header index, at the cost of building the TUs
(whose `.d` files it reuses).
